# RFID Hall Pass

For my final project IB computer science project I designed an RFID hall pass system. This system utilizes a raspberry pi connected to an
rfid scanner and small touchscreen display that allows students to easily check in and out. The time the student leaves and returns as well as their name
are recorded automatically. The system connects to an AWS server with MySQL to access information about students, and saves the log in a Google Sheet accessible to the teacher.

The RFID scanner triggers changes in the GUI where the user can interact via touchscreen. A user flow chart can be seen below.
