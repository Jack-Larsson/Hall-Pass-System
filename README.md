#RFID Hall Pass
For my final project IB computer science project I designed an RFID hall pass system. This system utilizes a raspberry pi connected to an
rfid scanner and small touchscreen display that allows students to easily check in and out to go to the restroom. The time the student leaves and returns as well as their name
are be recorded automatically. The system connects to an AWS server with MySQL to access information about students, and saves the log in a Google Sheet accessible to the teacher.

A video of the end-user functionality can be seen below
